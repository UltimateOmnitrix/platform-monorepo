# ============================================================
# INFRASTRUCTURE PIPELINE
# ============================================================
# Purpose:
# This workflow manages the continuous deployment of Google Cloud
# infrastructure using Terraform. It automatically plans and applies
# infrastructure changes whenever Terraform code is updated.
#
# What this workflow does:
# - Authenticates GitHub Actions to GCP using OIDC and Workload Identity Federation (keyless)
# - Initializes Terraform with a remote GCS backend for state management
# - Generates a Terraform execution plan for infrastructure changes
# - Applies approved infrastructure changes to the production environment
#
# Execution Behavior:
# - On pull requests: runs `terraform plan` for review (no changes applied)
# - On push to the main branch: runs `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`
# - Only triggers when infrastructure-related files are modified
#
